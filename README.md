# Advanced Calculator - GUI Application with Dark Mode and History Feature

## Project Overview

This project is an Advanced GUI Calculator built with Pythonâ€™s tkinter library, designed to provide a simple and user-friendly interface for 
performing basic arithmetic calculations. In addition to standard calculator functions, this application offers Dark Mode and History Tracking 
features to enhance usability and accessibility.

The GUI design prioritizes simplicity and ease of use, with carefully selected color schemes and intuitive button layout.
This makes it suitable for everyday calculations, while the code provides a solid example of using tkinter to create customizable applications with advanced features.

## Features

### 1. Basic Calculator Functions:
- Supports fundamental operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

- Also includes support for decimal points and parentheses for more complex calculations.

### 2. Dark Mode Toggle:
- A toggle button allows users to switch between light and dark modes.

- Dark mode provides a pure black background for a comfortable, eye-friendly experience in low-light environments.

- All components, including buttons, background, and margins, adapt to the selected mode for consistency.

### 3. Calculation History:
- A history section tracks previous calculations with results.

- Users can review their recent calculations without having to re-enter expressions.

- This feature is implemented using a list box widget that displays the history within the main application window.

### 4. Special Buttons:
- Clear Button (Red): Clears the entire expression.

- Delete Button: Removes the last character of the current expression, allowing for easy corrections.
